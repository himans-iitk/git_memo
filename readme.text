I am learning again the way to use git, its working and using it for the project, creating a new branch, merging it with the previous ones. Although, I have learned it several times, but everytime I learned, I either forget it, or didn't listen properly. This Time I am thing to inplement it as a whole so that git become unavailable to disrupt me anymore in anyform.

Apart from that, I would also like to work in a manner that I will use it again and again so that I will always be able to follow it.
